## 1 Introduction

The [Intelligent Document Service](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/118388) app service uses AI and OCR technologies to extract text and key value pairs from images of documents in bulk. For more information, see the [Technical Provider](#technical-provider) section.


### 1.1 Features

* Extract data from images in bulk and map data to an entity
* Train a model using sample images by marking specific areas in images
* Support [Mendix SSO](/appstore/modules/mendix-sso)

### 1.2 Limitation

* Currently only supports images in JPG and JPEG formats
* Each image file size cannot exceed 50 MB

### 1.3 Prerequisites

* This app service works best with Studio Pro 8 versions starting with [8.18.15](/releasenotes/studio-pro/8.18#81815) and 9 versions starting with [9.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.0).
* For optimal recognition results, make sure that documents with small fonts have high resolutions:
  * If images are made using a scanner, it is recommended to use 300 dpi for texts in font size 10 pt or larger and 400-600 dpi for texts in font size 9 pt or smaller
  * If images are taken using a digital camera, it is recommend to use at least a 5-megapixel sensor with auto focusing and flash disabling features, fit the page entirely within the camera frame, and distribute lighting evenly across the page to avoid any dark areas or shadows on the image


## 2 Installation

1. Go to the [Intelligent Document Service](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/118388) component page in the Marketplace and download the *.mpk* file.
2.  To add the Intelligent Document Service to your app in Mendix Studio Pro, follow these steps:
    1.  In the **App Explorer** (in Studio Pro 9) or **Project Explorer** (in Studio Pro 8), right-click the app.
    2.  Click **Import module package** and then select the *.mpk* file.

        ![pop-up-menu-in-app-explorer](attachments/intelligent-document-service/import-module-in-app-explorer.png)

        In the **Import Module** dialog box, **Add as a new module** is the default option when the module is being downloaded for the first time, which means that new entities will be created in your app.

        {{% alert type="warning" %}}If you have made any edits or customization to a module that you have already downloaded, be aware of the **Replace existing module** option. This will override all of your changes with the standard Marketplace content, which will result in the creation of new entities and attributes, the deletion of renamed entities and attributes, and the deletion of their respective tables and columns represented in the database. Therefore, unless you understand the implications of your changes and you will not update your content in the future, making edits to the downloaded modules is not recommended.{{% /alert %}}

   3. In the **Import Module** dialog box, click **Import**. 
   4. Wait until a pop-up box states that the module was successfully imported. Click **OK**.
   5. Open the **App Explorer** or **Project Explorer** to view the **IntelligentDocService** module. You can also find the app service in the **Document Data Capture Service** category in the **Toolbox**.

### 4.2 Creating an Import Mapping{#mapping-file}

You need to use an [import mapping](/refguide/mapping-documents#import-mappings) to populate extracted data into an entity. If necessary, you can further process the entity with [event handlers](/refguide/event-handlers).

1.  To create an import mapping, you need a JSON structure. Perform the following steps to generate the JSON structure:
    1.  Log into the [Document Model Training](#document-model-training) application with your Mendix account.
    2.  Click **Environment** to show the **Existing Models** list.
    3.  Select your trained model. Make sure that the **Status** of the model is **Published**. Note down the **Model Id**. You will need it when you [extract data with the trained model ](#extraction-activity).
    4.  Click **Download JSON Structure**. The **Generate JSON Structure** dialog box opens.
    5.  Drag one of the sample images, which you used to train the document model, into the box where it says **Drag image files here**. You can also click **Browse** and select the file.

        ![Sample Extraction dialog box](attachments/intelligent-document-service/sample-extraction-dialog-box.png)

    6. Click **Download** to get the JSON structure.

    {{% alert type="info" %}} Generated JSON structure file size cannot exceed 50MB. {{% /alert %}}
    
2.  To add the JSON structure to your app, perform the following steps:
    1.  In the **App Explorer** or **Project Explorer**, right-click the module or the folder where you want to add the generated JSON structure.
    2.  From the pop-up menu, select **Add other** > [JSON structure](/refguide/json-structures).

        ![json-structure](attachments/intelligent-document-service/json-structure.png)

    3. In the **Add JSON Structure** dialog box, enter a **Name** for the JSON structure and click **OK**. The **JSON Structure** dialog box opens.
    4. In the **JSON Snippet** box, add the content of the JSON structure that you have generated. The system converts the JSON snippet into a schema structure automatically. You will need this schema structure to create the import mapping.
    5. Click **OK** to save the changes and close the dialog box.
3.  To create the import mapping, perform the following steps:
    1. In the **App Explorer** or **Project Explorer**, right-click the module or the folder where you want to add the import mapping.     
    2. From the pop-up menu, select **Add other** > **Import mapping**.
    3. In the **Add Import Mapping** dialog box, enter a **Name** for the import mapping and click **OK**. The **Select schema elements for import mapping** dialog box opens.    
    4.  For **Schema source**, select **JSON structure** and **Select** the JSON structure that you created.
    
        ![schema-source-json-structure](attachments/intelligent-document-service/schema-source-json-structure.png)
    5. Click **OK** to save the changes and close the dialog box.

### 4.3 Extracting the Data with the Trained Document Model {#extraction-activity}

1.  In the **Toolbox**, drag **Intelligent Document Service** activity from the **Document Data Capture Service** category into your microflow.

    ![intelligent-document-microflow](attachments/intelligent-document-service/intelligent-document-microflow.png)

2. Create a list of image that inherits from `System.Image`. Images from where data are extracted should be passed as a list, as shown in the microflow above.
3.  Double-click the **Intelligent Document Service** activity to open the dialog box.

    ![Intelligent Document Service dialog box](attachments/intelligent-document-service/intelligent-document-service-dialog-box.png)

4. For **Model Id**, click **Edit** to enter the **Model Id** of your model.
5. For **Image List**, click **Edit** to select the **Image List** which inherits from `System.Image`.
6. For **Mapping**, **Select** the import mapping that you created to define how extracted data should be mapped into an entity.
7. Click **OK** to save the changes and close the dialog box.

{{% alert type="info" %}} Optionally for further automation, add [event handlers](/refguide/event-handlers) on the entity where you populate the extracted data. You can call your own microflow to process the extracted data when inserted into the entity. For example, you can modify, validate, and pass the data to next steps. By doing this, you can achieve full end-to-end automation.{{% /alert %}}
